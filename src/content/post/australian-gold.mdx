## Project Overview

[_Australian Gold_](https://australiangold.lt/) serves as a testament to our team's ability to design and implement a multi-domain retail management system. This beauty cosmetic product selling platform, tailored for the European market, efficiently manages three separate domains via a single Prestashop admin panel. 

Our team has ensured that all aspects - from products and orders to customer data - are efficiently managed through one unified interface. Users have the ability to manage their profiles, monitor their order details, and avail various payment options including direct bank transfer, post payment, and COD (Cash on Delivery).

## Core Technologies

The backbone of _Australian Gold_ comprises of two main technologies:

<DListItem dt="Prestashop">
  Our team utilized Prestashop, a powerful, open-source e-commerce solution, to govern all three domains. This provides a single admin panel, enabling efficient management of products, orders, and customer details across all platforms.
</DListItem>

<DListItem dt="MySQL">
  We implemented MySQL as the relational database management system. This crucial component efficiently stores and retrieves all data associated with products, orders, and customer profiles.
</DListItem>

## Key Features and Functionality

_Australian Gold_ offers a variety of features to enhance both customer shopping experience and admin management.

### Geolocation-Based Payment Integration

The platform supports a range of payment methods like direct bank transfer, post payment, and COD. These options are presented based on the customer's location, as determined by a third-party API.

### Email Notification System

The built-in notification system allows admins to send updates about product restocks, new arrivals, and order updates directly to customers' emails. This keeps customers up-to-date about their orders and the latest products available.

### Single Admin Panel

One of the highlights of the _Australian Gold_ platform is the single admin panel. This centralized interface enables our team to manage all three domains, greatly simplifying the process of keeping track of products, orders, and customer details.

The complex architecture and multifunctional capabilities of the _Australian Gold_ platform manifest our team's prowess in creating robust e-commerce solutions. The unified approach to managing multiple domains is a clear demonstration of the synergistic use of Prestashop and MySQL.
