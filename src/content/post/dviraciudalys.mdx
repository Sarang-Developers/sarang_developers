## Project Overview

[_Dviraciudalys.lt_](https://dviraciudalys.lt/) represents our team's innovative solution for the cycling market. This online commerce platform, dedicated to selling cycling gear and related products, operates within geographic areas defined by a third-party courier service.

Our team has developed the platform to ensure seamless user experiences - from order tracking, managing favourite items, to supporting multiple languages. Furthermore, all site content can be managed via a comprehensive backend admin panel, where admins can handle orders, catalogues, and product imports from third-party sources.

## Core Technologies

Our team has employed two primary technologies to bring _Dviraciudalys.lt_ to life:

<DListItem dt="CakePHP v3">
  We've utilized CakePHP v3, a powerful, open-source PHP framework, for constructing the platform. Its MVC architecture allows us to build scalable and secure e-commerce applications efficiently.
</DListItem>

<DListItem dt="MySQL">
  We've implemented MySQL as the database management system, crucial for efficiently storing and retrieving all data associated with products, orders, and customer profiles.
</DListItem>

## Key Features and Functionality
