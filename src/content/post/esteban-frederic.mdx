## Project Overview

[_Esteban Frederic_](https://esteban-frederic.fr/) epitomizes our team's commitment to creating solutions that make a difference. This platform offers consult-based support services to individuals across France, providing a safe and professional environment for those needing someone to share their problems with, or seek advice for everyday life.

The platform's back panel is managed through a role and permission system, allowing admins to monitor each ongoing call or support progress. Furthermore, a login system is set in place for employees to track their progress data and achievements based on their performance. 

## Core Technologies

To turn the vision of _Esteban Frederic_ into reality, our team has leveraged two main technologies:

<DListItem dt="PHP - CodeIgniter v4">
  We have used CodeIgniter v4, a powerful PHP framework, for building the platform's web applications. Its simplicity and elegant toolkit enable us to deliver dynamic and secure applications.
</DListItem>

<DListItem dt="MySQL">
  MySQL, a robust relational database management system, is utilized for efficient storage and retrieval of all data associated with user profiles, counselling sessions, and employee performance.
</DListItem>

## Key Features and Functionality

_Esteban Frederic_ stands out in the counselling space with its array of features designed for both clients and administrators.

### Role-Based Back Panel

The role and permission-based back panel allows admins to monitor each ongoing counselling session. This system ensures that the support service is efficient and well-managed.

### Employee Performance Tracking

We've integrated a login system for employees that provides them with their progress data and achievements counter, helping them track their performance and set personal goals.

### Third-Party Service Integration

Our team has incorporated several third-party services into the platform, such as Google Language Translate for multi-language support, Payment Gateway API for efficient financial transactions, and validation systems for phone numbers and card details.

_Esteban Frederic_ encapsulates our team's capabilities in creating meaningful digital platforms that impact people's lives positively. Our utilization of PHP - CodeIgniter and MySQL in building this robust and reliable counselling service demonstrates our mastery of technology to deliver effective solutions.
